    CR_Agent -- Queries --> BQ
    BQ -- Reads from --> GCS
    CR_Agent -- (Optional) Geocodes Addresses --> Geocoding
    CR_Agent -- (Optional) Sends Notifications --> Alerting
```

**Component Responsibilities:**

*   **NYC Restaurants CLI (`nyc-restaurants`)**:
    *   **User Interface**: Provides an interactive command-line interface using `Typer` and `Rich`.
    *   **Request Orchestration**: Constructs API requests based on user input and sends them to the Cloud Run Agent.
    *   **Response Rendering**: Parses API responses and displays results in a user-friendly format (tables, maps).
    *   **Configuration Management**: Handles local configuration for the agent URL.

*   **NYC Restaurants Cloud Run Agent (`CR_Agent`)**:
    *   **API Gateway**: Exposes a REST API (`/query`, `/geocode`, `/alert`) for the CLI and other services.
    *   **Data Abstraction**: Translates incoming requests into BigQuery queries.
    *   **Data Retrieval & Processing**: Queries health inspection data from BigQuery, potentially enriching it.
    *   **Agent Chaining**: Delegates specialized tasks (like geocoding or sending alerts) to other dedicated agents.
    *   **Scalability**: Runs on Google Cloud Run, automatically scaling to handle varying loads.

*   **BigQuery (`BQ`)**:
    *   **Analytical Database**: Stores and allows for complex querying of processed NYC health inspection data.
    *   **Performance**: Optimized for large-scale data analysis and fast query execution.

Follow these steps to get the NYC Restaurant Safety Finder CLI up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher.
    *   [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
*   **pip**: Python's package installer (usually comes with Python).
*   **Git**: For cloning the repository.
    *   [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
*   **(Optional) Google Cloud SDK**: If you plan to deploy or interact with the backend agent yourself.
    *   [Install gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GDSC-FSC/gdg-fsc-x-bc-cloud-workshop.git
    cd gdg-fsc-x-bc-cloud-workshop
    ```

2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Install the CLI in editable mode (for development or system-wide access):**
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
    This makes the `nyc-restaurants` command available in your terminal.

### Configuration

The CLI needs to know the URL of your deployed Cloud Run agent.

1.  **Set the Cloud Run agent URL as an environment variable:**
    Replace `https://your-cloud-run-service.run.app` with the actual URL of your deployed agent.
    ```bash
    export NYC_RESTAURANTS_AGENT_URL="https://your-cloud-run-service.run.app"
    ```
    > 💡 **Tip:** For persistent configuration, you can add this line to your shell's profile file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`) or create a `.env` file in the project root.

2.  **Using a `.env` file:**
    Copy the provided example and fill in your agent URL:
    ```bash
    cp config.example.env .env
    # Edit .env and set NYC_RESTAURANTS_AGENT_URL
    ```
    The CLI will automatically load variables from a `.env` file if found.

3.  **Passing the URL directly (per command):**
    You can also override the environment variable by passing `--agent-url` to any command:
    ```bash
    nyc-restaurants search --agent-url https://your-service.run.app --borough manhattan
    ```

#### Deploying the Backend Agent

If you don't have a backend agent deployed, you can use the example provided in the `examples/` directory.

<details>
<summary>Click to view Backend Agent Deployment Instructions</summary>

The `examples/` directory contains a basic Cloud Run agent (`cloud_run_agent.py`) and a `Dockerfile` to deploy it.

1.  **Navigate to the examples directory:**
    ```bash
    cd examples/
    ```

2.  **Authenticate `gcloud`:**
    Ensure you are logged into your Google Cloud account and have the correct project selected.
    ```bash
    gcloud auth login
    gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
    ```

3.  **Build and push the Docker image to Container Registry:**
    Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with your actual Google Cloud Project ID.
    ```bash
    gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/nyc-restaurants-agent
    ```

4.  **Deploy the image to Cloud Run:**
    Choose a region close to you (e.g., `us-central1`).
    ```bash
    gcloud run deploy nyc-restaurants-agent \
      --image gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/nyc-restaurants-agent \
      --platform managed \
      --region us-central1 \
      --allow-unauthenticated # Allow public access; for production, consider IAM
    ```

5.  **Note the Service URL:**
    After successful deployment, the `gcloud run deploy` command will output a "Service URL". This is the `NYC_RESTAURANTS_AGENT_URL` you need for the CLI configuration.

6.  **Return to the root directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```

For more detailed instructions, refer to `examples/README.md`.

## ⚠️ Limitations & Future Roadmap

This project is continuously evolving. Here are some known aspects and future plans.

### Current Limitations

*   **Mock Data Dependency**: When the Cloud Run agent is not deployed or configured, the CLI falls back to using local mock data. While useful for demonstration, it doesn't reflect live data.
*   **Geocoding/Alerting Agent Requirement**: The `--map` and `--alert` features rely on the backend Cloud Run agent having the capability to chain to external geocoding and alerting services. The provided `examples/cloud_run_agent.py` includes placeholder endpoints for these but might require further implementation on the backend side to be fully functional.
*   **Data Freshness**: The accuracy of the data depends on how frequently the BigQuery/GCS data sources are updated. The CLI itself does not control data ingestion.
*   **Single Restaurant Details**: The `details` command currently requires an exact restaurant name and optionally a borough; it doesn't support fuzzy matching or listing multiple matches.
*   **Rate Limits**: If interacting with external third-party geocoding or alerting APIs via the backend agent, rate limits might apply.

### Known Issues

*   **Map Generation on CI/CD**: Generating HTML maps with `folium` might require specific dependencies that are sometimes tricky in constrained CI/CD environments. Local execution is recommended.
*   **Windows Terminal Colors**: While `Rich` generally handles Windows terminals well, some older terminal emulators might have issues with full color and emoji rendering.

### Future Enhancements

We have several exciting features planned to make the NYC Restaurant Safety Finder even more powerful:

*   **Enhanced Filtering**:
    *   Filter by inspection date range.
    *   Search by specific inspection violations.
    *   Geographical radius search (e.g., "restaurants within 1 mile of X location").
*   **Advanced Details**:
    *   Display full inspection history for a restaurant.
    *   Option to view raw inspection data.
*   **CLI UX Improvements**:
    *   Autocompletion for commands and options (especially borough, cuisine).
    *   Interactive mode for guided search.
*   **Backend Enhancements**:
    *   Implement full external geocoding and alerting agent integrations in the example backend.
    *   Caching layer in the Cloud Run agent for frequently requested queries.
*   **Web UI**: Develop a simple web interface for non-technical users to access the data.
*   **Data Ingestion Pipeline**: Provide an example data pipeline (e.g., using Cloud Functions/Cloud Dataflow) for regularly updating the BigQuery data.

<summary>Q: What happens if the Cloud Run agent is not deployed or configured?</summary>
<p>
    A: The CLI is designed with a fallback mechanism. If the `NYC_RESTAURANTS_AGENT_URL` environment variable is not set, or if the agent is unreachable, the CLI will automatically switch to "mock data mode." This allows you to still explore the CLI's features and commands, albeit with static, predefined data instead of live inspection records.

<details>
<summary>Q: How can I generate an interactive map of restaurants?</summary>
<p>
    A: To generate an interactive HTML map, use the `--map` flag with the `search` command (e.g., `nyc-restaurants search --borough manhattan --map`). This feature relies on the backend Cloud Run agent successfully performing geocoding (converting addresses to latitude/longitude) for the restaurant locations. The resulting map will open in your default web browser.

<details>
<summary>Q: Can I use this with my own custom backend agent?</summary>
<p>
    A: Yes! The CLI is built to be flexible. As long as your custom backend agent implements the expected API endpoints (`/query`, `/geocode`, `/alert`) with the specified request/response formats (as detailed in the <a href="#agent2agent-architecture">Agent2Agent Architecture</a> section), you can configure the CLI to use your custom agent URL.

<details>
<summary>Q: How fresh is the data?</summary>
<p>
    A: The data freshness depends on the backend's data ingestion pipeline. Typically, NYC health inspection data is updated periodically (e.g., daily or weekly). The CLI queries whatever data is available in the BigQuery dataset at the time of the request.

### Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>Issue: `nyc-restaurants` command not found.</summary>
<p>
    **Solution:** Ensure you have installed the package in editable mode: `pip install -e .`. Also, check that your Python `Scripts` directory (where `Typer` CLIs are typically linked) is in your system's `PATH` environment variable. If using a virtual environment, activate it first.

<details>
<summary>Issue: Agent connection test fails (`nyc-restaurants test-agent`).</summary>
<p>
    **Possible Causes & Solutions:**
    <ul>
        <li>**`NYC_RESTAURANTS_AGENT_URL` not set:** Verify the environment variable is correctly set (`echo $NYC_RESTAURANTS_AGENT_URL`) or passed directly (`--agent-url`).</li>
        <li>**Incorrect URL:** Double-check for typos in the agent URL.</li>
        <li>**Agent not deployed or running:** Ensure your Cloud Run agent is successfully deployed and accessible. Check its logs in the Google Cloud Console.</li>
        <li>**Network issues:** Your local machine might have firewall or network restrictions preventing access to the Cloud Run service.</li>
        <li>**Authentication (if applicable):** If your Cloud Run service requires authentication, ensure your local environment is configured to provide valid credentials (e.g., `gcloud auth login`). The example agent is set to `--allow-unauthenticated` for simplicity.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Issue: Map not showing or displaying errors.</summary>
<p>
    **Possible Causes & Solutions:**
    <ul>
        <li>**Geocoding failed:** The `--map` feature requires the backend agent to successfully geocode restaurant addresses. If the agent's geocoding endpoint is not implemented or fails, maps cannot be generated. Check the agent's logs.</li>
        <li>**Browser security:** Sometimes browsers restrict local file access. Try opening the generated HTML file directly from your file system.</li>
        <li>**`folium` issues:** Ensure `folium` is correctly installed and that there are no underlying system issues preventing it from rendering.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
